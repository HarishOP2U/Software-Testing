## Agile model /Agile methodology /Agile process.

-> It is an Iterative and Incremental Approach, which means Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Process.

-> Agile is a defined process with some principles.

### Agile principles

1. Customer does not need to wait for a long time.
2. We develop, test, and release pieces of software to the customer with a few features.
3. we can accept/accommodate requirement changes.

-> There will be good communication between customers, business Analysts, developers & testers.

### Advantages

- Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development (or) We can accommodate Requirement changes in the middle of development.
- Releases will be very fast( Weekly)
- Customer no need to wait for a long time.
- Good communication between team.
- It is a very easy model to adopt

### Disadvantages

- Less focus on design and documentation since we deliver software very fast.

## Scrum

-> Scrum is a framework through which we build software products by following Agile Principles.

-> Scrum includes a group of people called a scrum team. Normally contains 5-9 members.
  1. Product Owner
  2. Scrum master
  3. Dev Team
  4. QA Team

- Product Owner: 
     - Define the features of the product in the form of user stories and epics
     - Prioritize features according to market value
     - Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed
     - Accept or reject results.

- Scrum Master:
     - The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process.

- Developers and QA:
     - Develop and Test the software.

### Scrum Terminology

-> User Story: A Feature/module in a software

-> Epic: Collection of user stories

-> Product backlog: Contains a list of user stories. Prepared by the product owner.

-> Sprint/Iteration: Period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the product owner and team, usually 2-4 weeks of time.

-> Sprint planning meeting: A meeting conducted with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and its duration.

-> Sprint backlog: List of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

-> Scrum meeting: Meeting conducted by scrum master everyday 15 mins. Called a scrum call/Standup meeting.
    - What did you do yesterday?
    - What will you do today?
    - Are there any impediments in your way?

  -> Sprint retrospective meeting: conducts meeting after completion of the sprint. The entire team, including both the scrum master and the product owner, should participate.

-> Story point: Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA in the form of the Fibonacci series.

-> Burndown chart: Shows how much work remaining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily.

#### Definition of Ready (DoR)

- User Story is clear
- User Story is testable
- User Story is feasible
- User Story defined
- User Story Acceptance Criteria defined
- User Story dependencies identified
- User Story sized by Development Team
- Scrum Team accepts User Experience artifacts
- Performance criteria identified, where appropriate
- The team has a good idea of what it will mean 
to Demo the User Story

### Definition of Done (DoD)

- Code produced (all ‘to do’ items in code completed)
- Code commented, checked in, and run against the current version in the source control
- Peer-reviewed (or produced with pair programming) and meeting development standards
- Builds without errors
- Unit tests written and passing
- Deployed to the system test environment and passed 
system tests
- Passed UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and signed 
off as meeting requirements
- Any build/deployment/configuration changes are implemented/documented/communicated
- Relevant documentation/diagrams produced and/or updated
- Remaining hours for task set to zero and task closed
