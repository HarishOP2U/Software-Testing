# JAVA
 
-> Purely object-oriented programming language.

coz without class we can't even write a single line of code in Java.

### Types of programming languages

1. structured - C, python (without using the oops feature we can still write a program)
2. object-based - VB, VBScript, python (support only class and object)
3. object orietend - C++, Java, C#, python 

### oops

1) class
2) object
3) polymorphism
4) Inheritance
5) abstraction
6) Encapsulation

### Features

1. platform independent
2. case sensitive language

   print(); PRINT() are different

3. Components

- JDK: Java Development Kit (Complete Java Software)
- JRE: Java Runtime Environment ( to install and run Java applications we need an environment)
- JVM: Java Virtual Machine (convert Java program to machine language)

-> Types of Java

   1. Core Java
   2. Advanced Java

Java 8 --- Sun Microsystems
Java 9 --- Oracle
Java 11+   preferable automation

JDK 11

Eclipse IDE / IntelliJ IDE/ Net Beans

IDE (integrated environment)

### Naming Conventions
1. Class name should start with an upper case letter.
2. Should not start with numbers ( we can have numbers in the middle of the name).
3. should not use special characters ~ ! %&*  ete..... (_ is accepted in the middle of class name).
4. Do not give spaces.

- Variable: is a container that can hold data. (x=100)
- Data Type: tells which type of data is stored( int, char, float....)

  int x = 100;

### Data Types

1. Primitive

-> Not classes just keywords

- byte, short, int, long -->integer number
- float, double --> decimal numbers
- char   --> single character
- boolean --> true/false

2. Non-primitive/ Collections/ Derived data types

-> Pre-defined class in Java

- String
- ArrayList
- HashSet
- HashMap
etc.

>> Java is a Statically typed language
>>
>> 1. int  x;
>>	
>> The data type must be specified
>>
>> 2. int x;
>>
>>  flaat x;   // not allowed
>>
>> 4. int  x=100;
>>
>> x=200;   //Change the value of the variable is possible
>>
>> Python is a dynamically typed language
>>
>> x=100;
>> x=10.50 // allowed
>> x="john" // allowed
>> x=true  // allowed

### Operator
An operator is a symbol that will perform the operation.

int a=10;
int b=20;

int result=a+b;

+   =  operators
a, b = operands

--> Types of operators

1. Arithmetic operators   + - * / % 
2. Relational/comparison operators  >  >=  <  <=  !=  == 
3. Logical operators   &&   ||  !
4. Increment & Decrement operators  ++  --
5. Assignment   =   +=   -=   *= /=  %=
6. conditional/ternary operator  ?: 

1. Unary operators      ++,  --  +=   -=   *= /=  %=  !     =
2. Binary operators    + - * / %   >  >=  <  <=  !=  ==  &&   ||   
3. Ternary  operator      ?:
