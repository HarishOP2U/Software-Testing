[OpenCart+-FRS.pdf](https://github.com/HarishOP2U/Software-Testing/files/13201544/OpenCart%2B-FRS.pdf)

-> FRS gives an overview what exactly the project is

-> Based on FRS we understand the Functionalities, and based on that we prepare test case, test scenarios

-> Mockup Screens are also provided in the FRS.

Mockup screens are dummy screens which are designed before actual screen so based on that we can write some test cases

### 3. Estimation

How much time we need for:
- to understand the requirements
- to write test cases
- for execution
- to verify the bugs
