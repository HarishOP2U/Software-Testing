### 2. Understanding & Explore the Functionality (FRS)

[OpenCart+-FRS.pdf](https://github.com/HarishOP2U/Software-Testing/files/13201544/OpenCart%2B-FRS.pdf)

-> FRS gives an overview what exactly the project is

-> Based on FRS we understand the Functionalities, and based on that we prepare test case, test scenarios

-> Mockup Screens are also provided in the FRS.

Mockup screens are dummy screens which are designed before actual screen so based on that we can write some test cases

> ### Estimation
> How much time we need for:
> - to understand the requirements
> - to write test cases
> - for execution
> - to verify the bugs
