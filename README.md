## Manual Testing

Software: A set of instrcutions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

Types:
1. System Software (Operating System, Device drivers, Servers, Utilities, etc.)
2. Programming Software (Compiler, Debuggers, Interpreters, etc.)
3. Application Software (Web Applicaion, Mobile Apps, Desktop Applications etc.)

### Software Testing:
It is The process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do.

-> is a part of software development process.

-> is an activity to detect and idetify the defects in the software.

-> to release a quality product to the client.

### Software Qualtiy
Based on some parameters we can say our software is a quality softwware or not, that are:

-> Bug-free

-> Delivered on time

-> Within budget

-> Meets requirements and/or expectations

-> Maintainable (user friendly)

A quality product does precisely what the users want it to do.

### Project & Product

Project: If the software application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then it is called a Project.
Service based company mainly deals with different projects, or clients, for ex: TCS, Infosis, Accenture, and they will work for n number of customers thought the world.

Product: If the software is developed for multiple customers based on market requirements then it is called a Product.
Product based company, devlops products based on market req, for ex. google(Docs, Maps,gmail), Microsoft(MS Word, Ms office), Orcale.

### Error, Bug/Defect & Failure

-> Error: Any incorrect human action that produces a problem in the system is called an error.
(normally committed by the develpoers)

-> Defect/Bug: Deviation from the expected behavior to the actual behavior of the system is called defect.
(are identified by the testers, at the time of testing phase)

-> Failure: The deviation identified by end-user while using the system is called a failure.
(failure will be there in customer environment)

### Why the Software has bugs?

-> Miscommunication

-> Software Complexity

-> Programming errors

-> Changing requirements

-> Lack of skilled testers
